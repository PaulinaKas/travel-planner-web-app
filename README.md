## **General info**:
Django-based app allowing to manage travels in a more efficient way. After adding first city, user is redirected to a new subpage where he can: 
* see weather forecast
* fill in travel schedule
* update schedules
* remove cities and add new ones.

If user wants to create a new list, he have to just go back to the main page and add a new city. Then the new list will be created by itself and generate a new subpage. In case you want to go back to previous list of cities, just remember id of list (e.g. travelplanner.pythonanywhere.com/**lists/5**) and enter this web address.  

## **Technologies**:
* Python 3.7.4
* Django 2.2.6
